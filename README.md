# CodeNinjas Unity Belts
This repository gives everyone completely free, open-source access to entire CodeNinjas Unity Belts. This includes full libraries of Purple, Brown, and Red Belt assets along with guides to complete the experience. 

These files have never been shown to the public before, and now they are free for anyone to use and modify to their liking. All copyright laws have been obeyed and I do not own nor make money off of any of this. **This is simply part of an ongoing passion of mine to open-source things that should have never been locked behind a paywall in the first place.** I am not responsible for any damages caused by the use of this repository or anything inside of it.
